# Module 6 Challenge 
## Background
You've been tasked to prepare some data for a recommendation system to help people find movie reviews and related movies. You will extract data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database, then merge the data together. The text extracted from these APIs can later be used with natural language processing methods.
Before You Begin

## Before starting the Challenge, be sure to complete the following steps:

Create a folder on your computer in c:/SRC/AI/data_source_challenge 

add the starter files retrieve_movie_data.ipynb 

    example.env from your file downloads. Rename example.env to .env and add your API keys to the file.Ensure the .env file is not listed when you perform a git status check on the repo, before performing your git add action.

Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

    Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
    Click on the "+" icon in the upper-right corner and select "New repository."
    Enter a name for your repository, add a description (optional), and choose whether the repository will be public or private.
    Click "Create repository." Note: Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or License. This is because you are pushing an existing repository from the command line.

    git init c:/SRC/AI/data_source_challenge 
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial repo setup
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    git push -u origin master
